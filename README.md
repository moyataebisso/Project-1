Battle Ships Board Game
Battle Ships is a board game where boats are randomly placed onto a grid and you have to try to guess the coordinates in the least amount of guesses.
Complile/Run:  You can watch the project0vid.mp4 file for a video walkthrough.
Bugs: Only the beginner mode works fully, the other modes are still being worked on.
